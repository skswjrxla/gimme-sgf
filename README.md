# what is this?
this code was made to download the 'undownloadable sgf files' at playok baduk.

# used librarys and modules :

1. selenium 
2. os
3. time

# if you are using gimme-sgf 
you have to copy and paste the whole html code of the page. ( via pressing f12 at chrome or etc... )

# if you are using gimme-sgf-link-v
you have to copy and paste the url
Also you gotta download chromedriver and put it on windows directory, then run it.

# why no exe?
I wanted to make these into .exe files but failed.
